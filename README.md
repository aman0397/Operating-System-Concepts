# Operating-System-Concepts
Implementation of some of the basic algorithms and concepts of operating system.
The First-Come-First-Serve is a <b>non preemptive</b> algorithm whereas round robin scheduling is <b>preemptive</b>.</br>
<h3>Critical Section</h3></br>Each process has a segment of code, called a <b>critical section</b> in which the process may be changing common variables, updating a table or writing a file.
</br><h3>Critical-section problem</h3> It is the problem of designing a protocol that the processes can use to cooperate such that when one process is executing in its critical section, no other process should be allowed to execute in tis critical section.</br>
<h3>Peterson's Solution</h3></br>It is a software based solution to the critical section problem.</br>Requirements satisfied by the Peterson's solution.</br>
